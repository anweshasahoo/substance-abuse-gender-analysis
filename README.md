- Drug Consumption (Quantified) dataset with demographics including gender.
## 📊 Results

- ✅ **No significant difference** in Alcohol use by gender (p = 0.6080).
- ✅ **Significant difference** in Amphetamines use by gender (p = 0.0000).
- ✅ **Significant difference** in Amyl Nitrite use by gender (p = 0.0000).
- ✅ **Significant difference** in Benzodiazepines use by gender (p = 0.0000).
- ❌ No significant difference in Chocolate use by gender (p = 0.1100).

This analysis shows that **certain substances exhibit strong gender-based usage patterns**, while others do not.
